## 2024-05-21 - Initial Environment & UX Scan
**Learning:** This is a minimal OS environment (kernel, no userspace). Standard web "UX" rules (ARIA, DOM) do not apply. "UX" here means boot feedback and developer console clarity.
**Action:** Focus on visual feedback (framebuffer splash) and console readability (ANSI colors) as the primary UX improvements. Verification relies on static code analysis as local QEMU is unavailable.
