**Learning:** In headless/serial environments, users often don't know how to exit the emulator (QEMU). Explicit instructions (e.g., "Press Ctrl+A, X to exit") transform a frustrating "stuck" moment into a smooth interaction.
**Action:** Always include emulator exit instructions in the final "System halted" message for kernel projects.
