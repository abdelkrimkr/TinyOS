# Running in VirtualBox

This document provides instructions for running the OS in VirtualBox.

## Requirements

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed on your system.
- The `os.iso` file generated by the build process.

## Creating the Virtual Machine

1.  **Create a new virtual machine:**
    -   **Name:** Choose a name for your VM (e.g., "TinyOS").
    -   **Type:** "Other"
    -   **Version:** "Other/Unknown"
2.  **Configure memory:**
    -   Allocate at least 128 MB of RAM.
3.  **Create a virtual hard disk:**
    -   You can skip this step, as the OS runs from the live ISO.
4.  **Configure storage:**
    -   In the VM settings, go to the "Storage" tab.
    -   Under the "Controller: IDE" section, select the empty optical drive.
    -   Click the disk icon and select "Choose a disk file...".
    -   Browse to and select the `os.iso` file from the `build` directory.
5.  **Start the VM:**
    -   Start the virtual machine. It should boot from the ISO and display the OS.
